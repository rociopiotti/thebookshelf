# The bookshelf

  

Demo site created by Rocío Piotti in 2020. This site is final project from course [The complete react fullstack course (2nd edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-react-fullstack-course/). 

The site has a login, home, book list, post and edit book and posts list pages.

Besides work done with the course, it had been added a few components such as admin, account panel and a modal box for success message. It had been also implemented draft-js instead of wysiwyg dependency since this one has some troubles when installing.

Use cases:
- If the user is not logged the page shows the Homepage where a list of books is display. The user can click in each book to see the review.
- The user can log in with demo email (already set in page). Once login, the user can either add a new post or see all posts done.
